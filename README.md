# What is DevOps

DevOps is a software engineering culture and practice that aims at unifying software development(Dev) and software operation(Ops)...

DevOps aims at shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, more dependable releases, in close aligment with business objectives


# DevOps is ...

* DevOps is first a Culture of collaboration between developers and operations people
* This culture has given rise to a set of Practices
* DevOps is a grassroots movement, by practicioners, for practitioners

# DevOps is NOT ...

* DevOps is NOT tools, but Tools are essential to success in DevOps
* DevOps is NOT a standard
* DevOps is NOT a product
* DevOps is NOT a job title 

# DevOps Concepts and Practices

* Build Automation
* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment (CD)
* Infrastructure as Code
* Configuration Management
* Orchestration
* Monitoring (SRE)
* Microservices
* .....

# What is CI

* Continuous Integration (CI): The practice of frequently merging code changes done by developers

* Traditionally, developers would work separately, perhaps for weeks at a time, and then merge all of their work together at the end of one large efford

* Continous integration means merging constantly throughout the day, usually with the execution of automated tests to detect any problems caused by the merge

# What does Continous Integration look like?

* Continous integration is usually done with the help of a CI server
* When a developer commits a code change, the CI server sees the change and automatically performs a build, also executiong automated tests. 
* This occurs multiple times a day
* If there is any problem with the build, the CI server immediately and automatically notifies the developers
* If anyone commits code, that "breaks the build" they are responsible for fixing the problem or rolling back their changes immediately so that other developers can continue working

# Why do CI 
* Early detection
* Eliminate the scramble 
* Frequent releases
* Continous testing
* Good coding practices

# What is Continous Delivery?

* Continous Delivery (CD): the practice of continously maintaining code in deployable state

* Regardles of whether or not the decision is made to deploy, the code is always in a state that is able to be deployed

# Standard Software Development

Dev team -> QA team -> Operatio team
